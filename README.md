# Hanzu
It's a tool that allows you to learn chinese characters.

It creates a dictionary (.txt) which stores every hanzi you put in. The translate is retrieves thanks to a RESTFul API! So you juste have the hanzi you know and try to memorize them.

- There no pinyin yet, it could be cool to have it!
- More translation for a Hanzi because one Hanzi could mean different things
- Possibility to reset the dictionnary, or to edit it with a list for instance
